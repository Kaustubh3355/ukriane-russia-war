    <ul style="font-size: 25;color: darkolivegreen;">
        <li>China has called for a cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine, releasing a 12-point “peace plan” on the one-year anniversary of the invasion</li>
        <li> According to, the US announced a new $300 million arms package for Ukraine in May 2023, bringing the total value of US security assistance to Kyiv to $37.6 billion since Russia’s February 2022 launch of the invasion.</li>
        <li>According to, Kyiv’s peace plan is the only way to end Russia’s war in Ukraine and the time for mediation efforts has passed, a top aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said.</li>
        <li>There have since been more than 20 attempts to have a ceasefire, according to Ambassador Mikko Kinnunen, special Ukraine representative of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). None has lasted long and soldiers are still being killed on the front line. </li>
